#Testing Repository
for most of my tests in java jdk 1.9 or later is required to configure

-For Password Generator GsonFormat is required I will eventually make an installer

- Right now my Main Text Editing laptop is really bad (I do have a self built desktop but i find it extremely hard to focus on it)

-Current goals finish Password Generator, Integrate with test.java, Make an installer, also work on test.java
